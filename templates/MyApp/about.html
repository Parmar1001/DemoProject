              <p>A bankâ€™s major business segments are retail banking, wholesale banking, and wealth management. While banks might have different names for their various business operations, they still have the same business functions as these three categories. Some larger banks also have business segments outside of the traditional three, such as treasury services or insurance. However, the revenue generated by those segments is small compared to the primary segments.</p>
